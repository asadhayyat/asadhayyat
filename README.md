👋 Hey there, I'm Asad
Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I’m an iOS developer who turns coffee ☕ into elegant, performant Swift code. Whether it's UIKit, SwiftUI, Core Data, or pushing pixels with Metal – I love building apps that are both beautiful and functional.

🚀 What I Do
🔨 iOS Development (Swift / SwiftUI / UIKit)

🧠 Architect clean and scalable code (MVVM, VIPER, Clean Architecture)

🧪 TDD / Unit Testing / UI Testing

🧩 Integrate APIs (REST/GraphQL)

🎨 Build pixel-perfect UI with a dash of animation magic

☁️ Backend communication
